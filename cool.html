<h1 class="headertext-western"><a name="ch1"></a>The Childhood of
Fovero, Hugo, and Kason</h1>
<p class="indentedtext">A long time ago, in a far away land where
animals could walk and talk like humans, there lived a small kit-fox
named Fovero. She was an energetic child, bright eyed and bushy
tailed, both in spirit and in the most literal sense. She was
somewhat mischievous, hopping over fences and playing pranks on
people, but she was honest and always ready to apologize, earning her
reputation in the village as troublesome but sweet child.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">She was good friends with a wolf-pup named
Kason. They played together often, imagining themselves going on
adventures. She also sometimes played with a mountain lion-cub named
Hugo, though Kason never joined in, for his <span style="font-style: normal">mother</span>
told him never to trust felines. Fovero did not play with Hugo that
often, he was very shy, and she preferred Kason a little more.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">As time moved forward and Fovero grew a
little, she found Kason to be a bit difficult; he had a short temper,
and he could be very hurtful from time to time, though Fovero's
backtalk never helped the situation. When she was hurt, she found
Hugo to be very kind and compassionate, and because of this she grew
closer to Hugo. Kason always got around to apologizing, so Fovero
never stopped being friends with him. One argument in particular was
about Kason's mistrust of Hugo. Kason never got along with Hugo,
until he was properly introduced by Fovero. After much difficulty,
Kason saw how kind Hugo was and came to accept him. From then on,
Fovero, Hugo, and Kason all hung out together and had good times.</p>
<h1 class="headertext-western"><a name="ch2"></a>The Arrival of
Mysterious Aleah</h1>
<p class="indentedtext">They all kept growing together, and now they
were on the cusp of adulthood. something strange happened. A border
collie rode in on horse, and she was somber, not saying much. She
only asked for a place to stay and to eat, and when Fovero offered
her hospitality, the border collie remained silent, nodding her head
as if to nervously say, 'thank you'. When Fovero's family began to
eat, They asked the border collie's name. The border collie replied,
&quot;Aleah&quot;, and Aleah silently continued eating. Fovero then
asked where she came from. At this question, Aleah stopped eating and
misery was all over her face. &quot;I'm sorry&quot;, said Fovero.
They finished eating, and got ready for bed. Fovero was curious about
Aleah, but, not wanting to pry, she asked nothing and went to bed.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">When the sun came up, Hugo visited them. He
was intrigued when he saw Aleah, not knowing who she was or where she
was from, so Fovero introduced her to him. Aleah was given food for
her travel, and she went to pack up and leave. &quot;I'm surprised
you didn't know she was here&quot;, said Fovero. &quot;I was busy
with other things&quot;, said Hugo. He looked at Aleah, &quot;Is she
alright by the way?&quot;. &quot;I'm not so sure&quot;, said Fovero,
&quot;Yesterday, she looked so sad, and I think she might be lost&quot;.
Hugo went for Aleah and talked to her. &quot;Fovero and I think
you're lost,&quot; said Hugo, &quot;and we can offer you a place to
stay, if you need.&quot; Aleah nervously accepted.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">During the first weeks of Aleah's stay, she
came to Hugo often, finding comfort in his presence. She told Hugo
about her worries, and Hugo listened to her. He learned in time that
she was forced to leave her town, and he saw that she was very
distressed by this, so he asked nothing of it, fearing that it would
only upset her to question further. Aleah was always so somber and
worrisome, and it broke Hugo's heart. He too had his own sorrows to
share with Aleah, and they became good friends.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">Aleah became a big subject of conversation
among the townspeople. Kason himself was skeptical of Aleah for a few
days, but he got used to her. He only needed to know she wasn't a
robber, or worse. Aleah wasn't a big fan of being so talked about.
Luckily, interest in her seemed to die down as the townspeople found
something new to gossip about.</p>
<h1 class="headertext-western"><a name="ch3"></a>The King’s Death
and it’s Consequences</h1>
<p class="indentedtext">The king was old and everyone knew this.
Traditionally, the king held a court where all the dukes brought five
representatives from their land, and discussed politics, but over the
years, this was helping nobody. The Duke of Nordlichtestadt, Averdolf
the Raven, was especially off put by the council, as he could never
get approval for his plans for what he called &quot;purification of
species&quot; and was called a madman by the Duke of the south. He
stormed out of the castle one day, which made the king angry. A small
army was sent to Nordlichtestadt to clear up the issue, but when they
arrived a short battle was fought. The battle was concluded when a
bird scout of the royal eye sent a message that declared the king
dead. Since the king had failed to produce an heir, his last request
was for all the dukes to hold one last council to choose his
successor. when all of them showed up, Averdolf declared war to all
of them, The rest all declared war back on him, and then each other.
He knew that while he was powerful, he was not powerful enough to
conquer all of them, but he was smart enough. Since he was a raven,
he won over the respect of the royal eye (after all they were all
birds); an order was sent out by a royal eye to his top general to
invade his neighbor to the east. His conquest began before he even
arrived back at his castle.</p>
<h1 class="headertext-western">The Plight of the Villages</h1>
<p class="indentedtext">A man rode in on horse and declared that the
village was about to be invaded, and that. 
</p>
<p class="tableofcontents-western">@@@</p>
<p class="tableofcontents-western">Of the reuniting of Aleah and
Theophania</p>
<p class="indentedtext">When Aleah, Hugo, Kason, and Fovero arrived
at the camp ground of the refugees, Aleah saw something familiar out
of the corner of her eye. She looked again though the crowd and, for
the briefest of seconds, saw the familiar face again. Why was it
familiar? She was drawn to the face and when she pondered over what
she saw, it dawned on her that she saw the face of none other than
Theophania. 
</p>
<p class="indentedtext">&quot;how could that be?&quot; she whispered
to herself. She knew Theophania's fate and all the grief it caused
her; the grief struck her heart again. She felt a great longing to
see that face, and so she set off into the crowd without Hugo's,
Fovero's, or Kason's knowledge.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">She searched, though it was nearly impossible
to find anyone among the crowd. She bumped into people, and witnessed
many others grieving the loss of their homes, or their family. she
wanted to turn back now; she was getting anxious! She tried to find
Fovero or Hugo, but she was completely lost. She was nearing panic,
but she saw the familiar face once more, and that face stared back.
The face was beautiful, just as Aleah remembered, and the eyes spoke
of a great longing. It was not just the trick of the eye, this was
Theophania. They walked towards each other. Aleah began to cry, for
she missed Theophania. She leaped and hugged her so tight, as if
never to let go. Eventually She did let go, and she wanted to ask
many questions.</p>
<p class="tableofcontents-western">The throwing of stones</p>
<p class="indentedtext">Aleah and Theophania were dragged by the
angry crowd. They where thrown to the ground by the mob. The voices
yelled horribly and Aleah feared for her life. An apple was thrown at
them, then a small rock, which hit Aleah, and then someone hurled a
stone at Theophania. She collapsed to the ground and Aleah leaped for
her. She cried and backed away with Theophania's unconscious body.
Another stone was hurled ad she was hit. It stung and she yelled; a
little blood came out. The fearful cry of Hugo was heard.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">&quot;Stop it! Please!&quot;, he yelled in
anguish, &quot;Stop!&quot;</p>
<p class="indentedtext">He held his arms out over the two.</p>
<p class="indentedtext">&quot;&quot;</p>
