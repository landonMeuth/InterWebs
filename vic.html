		Foreword:
	</h3>
	
	<p>
		In this page, you will learn about how to program the Vic-20. It is a very interesting machine, because almost every aspect of it's operation is handled directly by the user through commands. Most modern computers have a user friendly layer that protects you from all the complicated parts, which makes it easier to use; however, there is a great value to understanding computers at the lower level, and its just plain fun. It might sound somewhat intimidating, but it's not as complicated as its wrapped up to be, so let's begin!
